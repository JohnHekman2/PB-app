# Ignore everything in the project by default

# --- 3. EXPLICIT BLOCKS (SAFETY) ---
# Even though we are ignoring *, explicitly block these folders

# --- 4. THE WHITELIST (WHAT TO KEEP) ---
# Un-ignore (Track) all Python script files

# Un-ignore this .gitignore file itself (so it is tracked)

# Optional: Un-ignore requirements.txt (Highly recommended to track this too)
